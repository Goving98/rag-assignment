This project involves building a full-stack application that allows users to upload, store, and interact with various document types (PDF, PPT, CSV, etc.) through advanced NLP querying. The application implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent to handle user queries on uploaded documents efficiently.

Current Status
The RAG model is functional and has been tested in a controlled environment.
Currently working on integrating the model with the backend, with a few issues to resolve regarding seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.
Features:
Document management (upload, store, interact)
User authentication and secure access
NLP-powered RAG agent for document-based querying
Efficient parsing with unstructured.io for handling complex documents
